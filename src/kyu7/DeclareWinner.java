/*
 * 7 kyu - Two fighters, one winner.
 *
 * https://www.codewars.com/kata/577bd8d4ae2807c64b00045b/train/java
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 * Create a function that returns the name of the winner in a fight between two fighters.
 *
 * Each fighter takes turns attacking the other and whoever kills the other first is victorious.
 * Death is defined as having health <= 0.
 *
 * Each fighter will be a Fighter object/instance. See the Fighter class below in your chosen language.
 *
 * Both health and damagePerAttack (damage_per_attack for python) will be integers larger than 0.
 * You can mutate the Fighter objects.
 *
 * Your function also receives a third argument, a string, with the name of the fighter that attacks first.
 *
 * Example:
 *      declare_winner(Fighter("Lew", 10, 2), Fighter("Harry", 5, 4), "Lew") => "Lew"
 *      Lew attacks Harry; Harry now has 3 health.
 *      Harry attacks Lew; Lew now has 6 health.
 *      Lew attacks Harry; Harry now has 1 health.
 *      Harry attacks Lew; Lew now has 2 health.
 *      Lew attacks Harry: Harry now has -1 health and is dead. Lew wins.
